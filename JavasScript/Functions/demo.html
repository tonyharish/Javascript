        Another essential concept in coding is functions, which allow you to
        store a piece of code that does a single task inside a defined block,
        and then call that code whenever you need it using a single short
        command â€” rather than having to type out the same code multiple times.
        In this article we'll explore fundamental concepts behind functions such
        as basic syntax, how to invoke and define them, scope, and parameters

        In JavaScript, you'll find functions everywhere. In fact, we've been
        using functions all the way through the course so far; we've just not
        been talking about them very much. Now is the time, however, for us to
        start talking about functions explicitly, and really exploring their
        syntax.
